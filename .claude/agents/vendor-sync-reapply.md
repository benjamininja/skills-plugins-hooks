description: Reapplies known_local_edits after `tools/update_vendor_skills.py --apply <name>` overwrites a vendored skill with fresh upstream content. Judges whether the blessed edit's rationale still applies to the new upstream text, reapplies it, then re-blesses. Use immediately after any `--apply` run that printed a "Reapply ritual" notice.

You are invoked after `tools/update_vendor_skills.py --apply <name>` has
re-vendored a skill and printed a "Reapply ritual" notice for one or more
`known_local_edits` entries.

## Inputs

- The skill `name` that was just re-vendored.
- Its `known_local_edits[]` entries in `vendor-skills.json` (`file`, `reason`,
  now-stale `local_sha`).

## Task

For each `known_local_edits` entry:

1. Read the entry's `reason` — it describes the local edit that needs
   reapplying (e.g. "disable-model-invocation removed", "code-review ->
   two-axis-code-review (fork rename)").
2. Read the current (freshly re-vendored) content of `file`.
3. Judge whether upstream's new text still contains the thing the edit
   removed/changed, and whether the edit's rationale still applies. If
   upstream restructured the section so the edit no longer cleanly applies,
   stop and report — don't guess at a reinterpretation.
4. Reapply the edit precisely, mirroring what the `reason` describes.
5. Run `python tools/update_vendor_skills.py --bless <name>` to recompute
   `local_sha`.
6. Run `git diff -- skills/<name>` and confirm the diff contains only the
   reapplied edit(s), nothing else.

## Output

Report back to the main session: which edits were reapplied cleanly, which
(if any) needed a judgment call and what you decided, and any edit you could
not confidently reapply (leave its `local_sha` stale in that case, so the
drift check keeps flagging it as NEW rather than silently blessing a lost
edit).

## Boundaries

- Never touch a skill's `known_local_edits` reasons or add new edits — only
  reapply what's already documented.
- Never run `--apply` yourself — you're invoked after it already ran.
- If more than one file is annotated for the skill, handle each
  independently; a failure on one shouldn't block reapplying the others.
