# Catalog

> **Generated file — do not hand-edit.** Rebuild with

## What's in this repo

- **Skills** (36 loadable: 4 authored, 31 vendored, 1 forked) — one folder per skill under `skills/`, each with a `SKILL.md`; junctioned into `~/.claude/skills/` per machine.
- **Plugins** (3, manifest-only) — cataloged upstream bundles whose ~30 skills are deliberately not vendored (unused Fabric workloads). See `plugins/README.md` / ADR-0002.
- **Hooks** (3, all installed on this machine) — deterministic event-triggered scripts under `hooks/`, registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`. See `hooks/README.md`.
- **Vendor cache** (1) — pristine, never-loaded upstream mirrors of forked skills, for diffing. See ADR-0001.
- **Agents** (3 here: plan-gate-sync-auditor, skill-safety-auditor, vendor-sync-reapply) — see each agent's own frontmatter `description`, and `docs/adr/` for the decision record behind it.

## Skills

Tags follow the routing-map axes (see README "Routing: which skill, when"): stage = plan / crystallize / execute / cross-cutting; domain = engineering-flow / powerbi-fabric / dynasty / frontend / comms / reference / meta. Invocation: `model` = reachable without a slash command (default); `user` = `disable-model-invocation: true`, slash-command only.

|---|---|---|
| **fabric-authoring** | [microsoft/skills-for-fabric](https://github.com/microsoft/skills-for-fabric) | Manifest only — the ~12 skills it references are not physically vendored (unused Fabric workloads: Spark, Warehouse, Eventhouse, Eventstream, Activator, medallion). |
