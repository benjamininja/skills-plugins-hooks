# Blast-radius-tiered model-invocation for a subset of router skills

## Context

[ADR-0005](0005-skill-routing-and-drift-detection.md) considered and
rejected blanket auto-invocation for Pocock's flow-entry/router skills,
reasoning that they're deliberately `disable-model-invocation: true` because
the model shouldn't silently decide to kick off a multi-session flow on its
own. It built a `SessionStart` routing-index nudge
(`hooks/skill-catalog-health/`) instead: the model can surface "this looks
like `/wayfinder` territory," but the human still decides.

Revisiting this: ADR-0005's reasoning treats "router skill" as one bucket,
but the actual risk a wrongly-triggered skill carries isn't uniform across
that bucket. What matters is what happens on a false-positive trigger:

- A **nudge that's ignored** degrades to status quo — the user has to
  remember and type the command themselves, exactly as if the hook didn't
  exist. Cheap failure.
- An **auto-invoked skill that writes to shared, external state** (creates
  issues on a tracker, runs an installer, writes files across a repo
  unprompted) is a real action taken on a guess. Expensive, sometimes
  irreversible failure.
- An **auto-invoked skill whose worst case is a conversation, or a local
  git-tracked file write** sits in between: visible in `git diff`, trivially
  reversible, no one but the current user is affected either way.

That last category was hiding inside ADR-0005's single "router skills"
bucket. Auditing all 13 then-manual skills by what they actually do if
triggered wrong:

- `ask-matt` — pure routing, asks a question, no side effects.
- `grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` — interview-driven; `grill-with-docs`
  writes ADRs/glossary entries, but locally, git-tracked, reversible.
- `teach` — writes to a local teaching-workspace directory (lessons,
  learning records), same local/reversible shape.
- `writing-great-skills` — pure reference, no side effects.
- `triage` and `wayfinder` were initially proposed for this tier too, but
  re-reading their bodies showed both write to the **external issue
  tracker** (triage moves issues through tracker state; wayfinder creates a
  `wayfinder:map` issue plus child ticket issues) — that's shared, external
  state, not a local diff. Both stay in the high-consequence bucket.
- `handoff`, `setup-project-memory`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `to-spec`,
  `to-tickets`, `implement`, `improve-codebase-architecture` were not
  re-examined in detail here — they were already understood to run
  installers, write across a repo, or touch external trackers, matching
  ADR-0005's original reasoning without needing a recheck.

## Decision

Flip `disable-model-invocation` off (remove the line) for exactly five
skills — `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `teach`, `writing-great-skills`,
`ask-matt` — whose worst-case wrong-trigger outcome is a conversation or a
local, git-tracked file write.

Leave every other previously-manual skill untouched, including `triage` and
`wayfinder`, which were considered and rejected for this tier specifically
because they write to the external issue tracker.

**Mechanism**: record each edit in `vendor-skills.json`'s existing
`known_local_edits[]` array (already used by `ask-matt` for an unrelated
edit) rather than the heavier `vendor-cache/` fork pattern from ADR-0001.
This is a single-field diff per skill, not a substantial rewrite — the fork
pattern exists for the latter (see `two-axis-code-review`, ADR-0001's only
current fork). `known_local_edits` already does the right thing for this
shape of change: `tools/update_vendor_skills.py`'s drift check classifies an
edited file as *known* drift (not *new* drift) as long as its blessed
`local_sha` still matches; when a future `--apply` re-vendors the skill and
overwrites the file, the tool's existing "reapply ritual" reminder is what
resurfaces the need to redo the one-line removal and re-`--bless`.

No change to `hooks/skill-catalog-health/` — its routing index is generated
at runtime from each skill's frontmatter, so it reflects the new
model-invocable status automatically.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Flip all 13 (override ADR-0005 wholesale)** — rejected; would reopen the
  actual load-bearing part of ADR-0005's reasoning (unprompted external-state
  writes), not just the part that turned out to be overbroad.
- **Full `vendor-cache/` fork pattern per skill** — rejected as
  disproportionate for a one-line frontmatter removal; `known_local_edits`
  already exists for exactly this case and is used elsewhere in the same
  file.
- **Include `triage`/`wayfinder` in the flipped tier** — initially proposed,
  rejected on closer reading of their bodies: both write to the external
  issue tracker, matching the exact risk ADR-0005 was written to guard
  against.

## Consequences

- `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `teach`, `writing-great-skills`, `ask-matt`
  can now be reached by the model without the user typing the slash command,
  closing the specific gap this ADR was written to close (planning/
  stress-testing and routing skills that should be reachable ambiently).
- `docs/adr/0005-skill-routing-and-drift-detection.md` is amended with a
  one-line status note pointing here; its body and reasoning for the
  remaining manual-only skills are otherwise unchanged and still authoritative.
- New maintenance surface: after any future `--apply` re-vendors one of
  these five skills, the removed `disable-model-invocation` line must be
  reapplied and re-`--bless`ed, same as any other `known_local_edits` entry.
  Real but pre-existing risk — see `ask-matt`'s prior entry for precedent.
