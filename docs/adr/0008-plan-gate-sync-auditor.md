# plan-gate-sync-auditor: a third agent, homed here despite auditing a different repo

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-07-17
- Scope: `.claude/agents/plan-gate-sync-auditor.md`

## Context

Running `/subagent-audit` against `project-memory-template` (a separate,
docs-only template repo) turned up almost no real subagent surface — it
doesn't dogfood its own scaffold, so most categories (context firewall,
schema transformer, MCP wrapper, parallel dispatch) had nothing to attach
to, and its `check-in-hygiene` hook already correctly covers what a
deterministic script can catch (unfilled placeholders, dangling references,
scoped to the current commit).

One real gap survived: `project-memory-template`'s own README and the
private root `C:\Users\benha\.claude\CLAUDE.md`'s plan-gate section both
call out, unenforced, that the three tier `CLAUDE.md` files carry a
**distilled paraphrase** of the root's plan-gate threshold and escape
hatches, not a byte-identical copy — "nothing enforces that the three
copies stay in sync" is the template README's own words. A text-diff hook
can't check this: the tiers are deliberately reworded for brevity, so
literal difference is expected and not itself a bug. Checking whether the
*meaning* still matches after either side changes is a genuine judgment
task.

The open question was placement: the auditor's subjects (root CLAUDE.md +
three tier files) live in two other repos (`dotclaude`, private; and
`project-memory-template`), neither of which has a `.claude/agents/` home
or memory scaffold today. Discussed with the user directly: `dotclaude` is
the more "obvious" home by subject matter, but this repo
(`skills-plugins-hooks-agents`) is the one every project already
junction-installs from — an agent here is reachable everywhere, matching
the precedent set by [ADR-0007](0007-first-subagents-vendor-sync-and-safety-audit.md)'s
first two agents. The user chose this repo.

## Decision

Add `plan-gate-sync-auditor` (background, category B — domain auditor) to
`.claude/agents/`. It reads both the root plan gate and the three tier
copies (all outside this repo's own tree — the agent's file-read scope
isn't confined to `skills-plugins-hooks-agents`, which is a departure from
`vendor-sync-reapply`/`skill-safety-auditor`'s repo-local scope, but not a
new mechanism — agents already read cross-repo where needed, same as
`setup-project-memory` reading tier content from `project-memory-template`
per ADR-0005) and reports semantic drift, never textual drift.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Home it in `dotclaude`** — rejected; that repo has no established
  `.claude/agents/` pattern yet, and centralizing in the one repo every
  project already links from is more consistent with how `setup-
  project-memory` and the two ADR-0007 agents are already discovered.
- **Home it in `project-memory-template`** — rejected; that repo has no
  `.claude/agents/` directory or memory scaffold to anchor the decision in,
  and (per the audit) has essentially no other subagent surface to build a
  precedent around.
- **A pre-commit hook doing text diff on the sync-marker block** — rejected;
  the tiers are deliberately reworded, not copied verbatim, so a literal
  diff would false-positive on every legitimate paraphrase and miss actual
  semantic drift hidden behind matching wording.
- **Building the deferred `check-in-hygiene` staleness/delete-offer
  features as subagents** — considered during the same audit pass;
  rejected as out of scope here because `project-memory-template` never
  has a live, filled-in scaffold instance to judge staleness of (only
  unfilled template content under `tiers/`) — that candidate belongs in a
  *consuming* repo, not this audit.

## Consequences

- Third agent in this repo's roster; `CATALOG.md`'s dynamic Agents line
  (added in ADR-0007's follow-up to `tools/build_catalog.py`) will pick it
  up automatically on next `build_catalog.py` run.
- First agent here whose read scope extends outside this repo's own
  working tree — worth noting if a future audit tightens agent tool/path
  scoping conventions.
- `project-memory-template` itself gets no new files from this decision —
  consistent with it having no memory scaffold to write into (per
  `/subagent-audit`'s own fallback: summarize in the report, don't force a
  write).
